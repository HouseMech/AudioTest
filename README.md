# Boss Fight Crossfader

Ever since playing games like Metal Gear Rising and Nier: Automata, I've developed a fascination with dynamic music tracks. I wanted to try using dynamic tracks in my Dungeons and Dragons games. I did some research into what other people have tried, programs and such and I used several of them, but I couldn't find one that had exactly what I needed. I built this tiny application to help me crossfade one track into another and back upon command.
